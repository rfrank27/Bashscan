SYNOPSIS
	bashscan.sh [SIGNATURE_FILE] [STARTING_PATH]

DESCRIPTION
	Bashscan is a simple commandline utility that analyzes binary strings in a file and compares them to strings in a signatures file.

	The tool will recusively go through all files in the the specified STARTING_PATH and look for binary using the strings utility and find all the matching strings in the given SIGNATURE file

	Numerous files are saved in the created bashscan directory
		badFiles.txt - list of unique file paths that contain signatures
		fileList.txt - list of files that were searched
		report.txt   - another copy of the report generated at the end of execution
		virusLog.txt - list of each match
					   [path]:[string_number]:[mathing_line]
					   		path          - absolute path of the matching file
					   		string_number - the nth string in $(strings [path])
					   		matching_line - the full string with the matching signature in red
						this file has colored output so it is recomended to just cat it out to the command line instead of using a text editor
